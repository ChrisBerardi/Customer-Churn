##Predicting Customer Churn
The ability to accurately predict customer churn, that is, predict which customers will cease to use a service a product, is of extreme importance to any business. The ability to predict churn allows for attempts to both prevent churn. 

There exist many complexities that come with modeling churn. The first and most important comes from the nature of the unbalanced nature of churn--far more customers will remain customers than will churn. If standard methods are then used to achieve a binary classification, very little churn will be predicted; the best way for a model to achieve the best fit to the ignore the minority churn for the majority. For this reason, rare event modeling must be done to adequately model churn.
